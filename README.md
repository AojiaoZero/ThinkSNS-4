# Socfony

Socfony is an open source social application, and basic security modules and social function modules have been preset in the software. Whether it is to deploy Socfony directly or as a basis for program development is wonderful.

- [**Socfony Server**](server) - A server that runs Socfony.
- [**Socfony Shared**](shared) - A set of shared packages.
- **Socfony Client** - A client that connects to the Socfony server.

Socfony is all developed in Dart language and uses gRPC API. You can deploy SOcfony directly or use it as a basic application. It's very nice to develop.
