# Socfony

Socfony is an open source social application, and basic security modules and social function modules have been preset in the software. Whether it is to deploy Socfony directly or as a basis for program development is wonderful.

- [**Socfony Server**](https://github.com/odroe/socfony) - Socfony server gRPC service.
- [**Socfony App**](https://github.com/odroe/socfony-app) - Socfony application.

Socfony server adopts Node.js runtime environment, TypeScript language and Nest.js framework to develop gRPC API.

Socfony App uses the Flutter framework for cross-platform development

## Reamap

Socfony is currently in the early development stage. For more development content, please visit [Projects page](https://github.com/odroe/socfony/projects).

## Get Started

We now clone Socfony's Git repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/odroe/socfony
```

We have more options for mirror warehouses. Below are the mirror addresses of our major code hosting platforms:

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/odroe/socfony">GitHub</a>
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/odroe/socfony">GitLab</a>
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    <a href="https://gitee.com/odroe/socfony">Gitee</a>
</div>

> Although we have mirror repositories on other git warehouse platforms, we only do development work in GitHub repositories.
