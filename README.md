# Socfony

Socfony is an open source social application, and basic security modules and social function modules have been preset in the software. Whether it is to deploy Socfony directly or as a basis for program development is wonderful.

- [**Socfony Server**](server) - A server that runs Socfony.
- [**Socfony Shared**](shared) - A set of shared packages.
- **Socfony Client** - A client that connects to the Socfony server.

Socfony is all developed in Dart language and uses gRPC API. You can deploy Socfony directly or use it as a basic application. It's very nice to develop.

## Reamap

Socfony is currently in the early development stage. For more development content, please visit [Projects page](https://github.com/odroe/socfony/projects).

## Get Started

We now clone Socfony's Git repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/odroe/socfony
```

We have more options for mirror warehouses. Below are the mirror addresses of our major code hosting platforms:

<div align="center>
    <a href="https://github.com/odroe/socfony">GitHub</a>
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/odroe/socfony">GitLab</a>
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    <a href="https://gitee.com/odroe/socfony">Gitee</a>
<div>

> Although we have mirror repositories on other git warehouse platforms, we only do development work in GitHub repositories.

### Server

Before the server runs, we need to configure the database connection:

> TODO: Configure the database connection.

### Client

TODO: Configure the client.
